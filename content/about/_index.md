{{< figure src="/static/img/about/me.jpg" alt="Mauro de Carvalho" class="about-pic" >}}

Hi, Iâ€™m Mauro, a software engineer from Uruguay ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ currently living in Dublin
ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª. I am a foodie and a gamer, but first and foremost, I am a passionate
programmer.

Ever since I started programming professionally 9 years ago, Iâ€™ve been involved
in a myriad of different projects, crafting code with programming languages
ranging from __Objective-C__, __Python__ and __Go__ to __PHP__, __VB__ and
__Java__.

I've also participated in ACM ICPC several times, but alas,
Iâ€™m too old for that now. I am always looking for new challenges to keep me
motivated and at the top of my game.

If you want to contact me or want to know more about me, drop me a line at
***mauro@maurodec.com***


## A few projects I've worked on...

I love Open Source and the ecosystem it has created and try to contribute
whenever I can. Here are some Open Source projects I've worked on in the past:

* [__Amet__](https://github.com/maurodec/amet), a Python 2 and 3 library for
  reading complex configuration objects from environment variables.

* [__This__](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_DeskClock/commit/e01d81ca81b29329a5c4130321314d087a9958f5)
  patch for Cyanogenmod  - that was [__later ported to LineageOS__](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_packages_apps_DeskClock/commit/1bd7a90878d1b580f68f32a4afa7df84b8a7e40c) -
  that allows the Android alarm to be snoozed or dismissed by flipping the
  device over.
* [__Metamon__](https://github.com/tryolabs/metamon), a collection of Ansible
  playbooks that allows quickly starting a Django application.
* [__SimpleRipple__](https://github.com/maurodec/SimpleRipple), a tiny CocoaPod
  that demonstrate how to add Material Design-like ripple effects to any iOS
  view.
