{{< figure src="/static/img/about/me.jpg" alt="Mauro de Carvalho" class="about-pic" >}}

Hi, I’m Mauro, a software engineer from Uruguay. I am a foodie and a gamer, but
first and foremost, I am a passionate programmer.
Ever since I started programming I’ve been involved in a myriad of different 
projects, crafting code with programming languages ranging from Objective-C, 
Python and Go to PHP, VB and Java.

I love Open Source and the ecosystem it has created and try to contribute 
whenever  I can ([Metamon](https://github.com/tryolabs/metamon) and 
[this](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_DeskClock/commit/e01d81ca81b29329a5c4130321314d087a9958f5) 
patch for Cyanogenmod are some of the things i had most fun doing). I also 
participated in ACM ICPC several times, but alas, I’m too old for that now.
I am always looking for new challenges to keep me motivated and at the top of
my game.

If you want to contact me or want to know more about me, drop me a line at
