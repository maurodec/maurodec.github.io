[It has recently been
announced](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/) that Microsoft
will be acquiring Github got USD 7.5b. The news was received by some with
dismay as Microsoft has historically been seen as a threat to Open Source
(Linux is a cancer, anyone?), while it was praised by others who consider
Microsoft has changed. What will the future hold for Github and Open Source?

## Github as a social hub for Open Source

Github was never the first service to offer free project hosting for Open
Source projects, however, it somehow managed to become a sort of social hub for
developers. For a few years now Github has pretty much been the de-facto place
to share your code. Whether this is good or not is up for discussion, but the
reality is that it has brought developers together and it has facilitated
communication and collaboration immensely.

## Microsoft enters the game

For a few years now Microsoft has been trying to change it's relation with free
software an Open Source. From Open Sourcing parts of .Net, to including the
Windows Subsystem for Linux and the release of Visual Studio Code. Acquiring
Github does indeed not seem that much of a strange acquisition for Microsoft.

Many, like the Linux Foundation have [backed the acquisition
up](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/microsoft-buys-github-the-linux-foundations-reaction/),
while many others have seen this as a disaster. What will happen remains to be
seen, will Microsoft play nicely? Is this yet another EEE strategy?

## My own thoughts

I personally do not trust Microsoft. Yes, they have been contributing to Open
Source projects like Linux, and they have massive Open Source projects of their
own like Visual Studio Code. However, this isn't enough for me to forget their
horrible track record. They have systematically acquired and proceeded to ruin
beloved products and companies. Although many people insist Microsoft has
changed, I am still fearful of what can happen to Github and how it could
affect the Open Source ecosystem.

I __really__ hope I am wrong and that Microsoft has indeed changed, but I will
remain skeptical for the time being.
