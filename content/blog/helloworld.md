Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

I've been meaning to have a place to write and express my thoughts for a while
now, so I figured I might as well start my own blog. My intention is to update
this as often as I can with posts about topics such as Software Engineering,
Programming or other interests of mine like Video Games.

I built this using the wonderful [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator 
which made everything surprisingly easy. I also handcrafted the blog theme from
scratch, thus, it is bound to change as time goes on and I realize things don't 
look as good as I had hoped or when they simply grow stale.

Enjoy your stay! üññüèº
