      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, speedrunning is trying to finish a game as fast as possible.
There&amp;rsquo;s different set of rules for each game (called categories), but it always
boils down to how fast a game can be finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games mean different things for different people. For some they are their
day-to-day source of entertainment or it&amp;rsquo;s their competitive nature that speaks
to them, while for others it may be childhood nostalgia. Whatever reason that
may be, GDQ, the seven day speedrunning marathon raises incredible amounts of
money for charity each year, and it only keeps on growing.&lt;/p&gt;
