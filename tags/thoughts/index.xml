      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/&#34;&gt;It has recently been
announced&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft
will be acquiring Github got USD 7.5b. The news was received by some with
dismay as Microsoft has historically been seen as a threat to Open Source
(Linux is a cancer, anyone?), while it was praised by others who consider
Microsoft has changed. What will the future hold for Github and Open Source?&lt;/p&gt;
