        <p>Text editors are probably the most basic tool of every software developer,
without them we would not be able to do our jobs. It makes sense then to try
and find out what the best text editor is, doesn&rsquo;t it? Is it Vim? Is it Emacs?
Is it another? It&rsquo;s important to first look at what we want in a text editor
before we are able to answer this.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, speedrunning is trying to finish a game as fast as possible.
There&rsquo;s different set of rules for each game (called categories), but it always
boils down to how fast a game can be finished.</p>

<p>Video games mean different things for different people. For some they are their
day-to-day source of entertainment or it&rsquo;s their competitive nature that speaks
to them, while for others it may be childhood nostalgia. Whatever reason that
may be, GDQ, the seven day speedrunning marathon raises incredible amounts of
money for charity each year, and it only keeps on growing.</p>

        <p>In an ideal world there&rsquo;s always time and resources available to refactor code
and to make sure it is as clean as possible. Even though it is well known that
refactoring code helps with maintainability and thus reduces development costs
in the long run, for various reasons refactoring does not always happen, or at
least not until things start to fall apart.</p>

<p>In this post I will tell a little horror story that happened to me recently and
that could have been avoided if we had stopped to refactor the code we were
working on&hellip;</p>

Macbook (which is where I run a local Hugo server to test things out), other
times I SSH into my Raspberry Pi and write there until I am on my Macbook
again. While writing my
<a href="/blog/learning-python/">Why I learned Python blog post</a> I asked some friends
for feedback, however, I did not want to push an unfinished post to Github
Pages, so I decided to serve my Hugo blog from my Raspberry Pi. I soon realized

        <p>It&rsquo;s sometimes a bit funny how trends come and go in tech.
For a long time dynamic websites were seen as the way to go, no matter
for what kind of content. Lately a lot of people have gone back to
basics and (thankfully) decided to build their sites as a collection
of static pages.</p>

<p>When I started this blog I decided I did not want to go through the
hassle of maintaining a complex site and decided to use Hugo, a static
site generator. In this post I will talk about my experience building
my blog using <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>

        <p>In Android applications, as well as in applications with a GUI in general,
doing work in the background is essential as we do not want the UI to be
blocked by long running tasks that may cause it to appear to be frozen.
The Android Framework provides a simple but interesting mechanism for
communicating with background threads via the use of the <code>Message</code> and
<code>Handler</code> classes. In this post I will attempt to explain not only how to use
them, but also how they relate to the <code>Looper</code> and the <code>MessageQueue</code>
classes.</p>

        <p>Some time ago I had to create a background color transition animation for an
iOS app I was working on. This animation was pretty similar to the ripple
effect Material Design buttons have. I thought it would be a fun idea to go
back and revise what I had done, change the animation so that it looks like the
Material Design ripple effect and create a UIView category with it.</p>

<p>This blog post shows an implementation of this animation that can be applied to
any UIView.</p>
