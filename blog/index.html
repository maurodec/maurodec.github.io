        <p>Originally described in the &ldquo;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
Object-Oriented Software&rdquo; book, decorators are a powerful design pattern that
allows us to extend or augment an object&rsquo;s functionality. In this post I will
show with some practical examples how this can be achieved in Python via the
<code>@decorator</code> syntax.</p>

        <p>Writing good tests, whether they are unit, acceptance, integration etc, is
hard. Few tests will run quickly but probably won&rsquo;t cover much of the code,
however, having high coverage doesn&rsquo;t mean your tests are good either.
The way tests are written also depends on what the software and it&rsquo;s structure
is. Notwithstanding, there&rsquo;s one aspect that I believe always helps,
simplicity.</p>

<p>Video games mean different things for different people. For some they are their

to them, while for others it may be childhood nostalgia. Whatever reason that

in the long run, for various reasons refactoring does not always happen, or at

For a long time dynamic websites were seen as the way to go, no matter

basics and (thankfully) decided to build their sites as a collection
of static pages.</p>
<p>When I started this blog I decided I did not want to go through the

        <p>In Android applications, as well as in applications with a GUI in general,
doing work in the background is essential as we do not want the UI to be
blocked by long running tasks that may cause it to appear to be frozen.
The Android Framework provides a simple but interesting mechanism for
communicating with background threads via the use of the <code>Message</code> and
<code>Handler</code> classes. In this post I will attempt to explain not only how to use
them, but also how they relate to the <code>Looper</code> and the <code>MessageQueue</code>
classes.</p>
