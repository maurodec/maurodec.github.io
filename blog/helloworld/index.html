        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to have a place to write and express my thoughts for a while
now, so I figured I might as well start my own blog. My intention is to update
this as often as I can with posts about topics such as Software Engineering,
Programming or other interests of mine like Video Games.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I built this using the wonderful <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> site generator
which made everything surprisingly easy. I also handcrafted the blog theme from
scratch, thus, it is bound to change as time goes on and I realize things don&rsquo;t
look as good as I had hoped or when they simply grow stale.</p>

<p>Enjoy your stay! üññüèº</p>
